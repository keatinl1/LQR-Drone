# LQR-Drone
Linear Quadratic Regulators or LQRs are an optimal control strategy. Kalman filters are a form of optimal estimator. When these two are put together, this is known as Linear Quadratic Gaussian or LQG.

See figure 1 for the results of applying the controller to the drone and scroll further for the explanation.
